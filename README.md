# Chocolate Reviews Scraper with BeautifulSoup

## Project Overview
This project is a web scraper built with Python to extract chocolate bar reviews from a webpage containing over 1,700 global reviews. The data is scraped from an HTML table and transformed into a structured format for analysis.

The scraper allows exploration of:
- Top cacao bean growing regions
- Countries producing the highest-rated chocolate bars
- Relationships between cocoa solids percentage and ratings

## Libraries Used

- `requests`  
- `BeautifulSoup` (from `bs4`)  
- `pandas`  
- `matplotlib.pyplot`  
- `numpy`

## Usage
1. Clone or download this repository.  
2. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script.  
3. The scraper fetches and parses the chocolate reviews data into a pandas DataFrame.  
4. Use the provided code or extend it to perform your own data analysis and visualization.

## Future Improvements
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Enhanced visualizations of rating trends  
- Scraping additional chocolate review sources
